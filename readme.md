# 30 Days of JS

Welcome to the **30 Days of JS** coding challenge! 🚀  
In this repository, I will be solving a wide range of JavaScript problems daily, focusing on essential topics such as **polyfills**, **closures**, **function composition**, and more. Each day is dedicated to solving at least one problem to improve my JavaScript skills and dive deeper into the fundamentals.

## 🏁 Challenge Overview

Over the next 30 days, I will be covering various JavaScript concepts, including:

- **Day 1-5**: Closures
- **Day 6-10**: Polyfills
- **Day 11-15**: Function Composition
- **Day 16-20**: Currying Functions
- **Day 21-25**: Event Loop and Async/Await
- **Day 26-30**: Miscellaneous Advanced Topics

Each day’s solution is located in its respective folder and explained in the code comments for easy understanding.

## 🛠 Topics Covered

- **Closures**: Explore how closures work in JavaScript and why they are useful for creating private variables, callbacks, and more.
- **Polyfills**: Learn how to write polyfills to ensure modern JavaScript features work in older browsers.
- **Function Composition**: Practice combining multiple functions into a single function to streamline operations.
- **Currying**: Understand currying and how it helps in function reusability and cleaner code.
- **Event Loop & Async Programming**: Dive into JavaScript’s asynchronous nature, including event loop, promises, and `async/await`.
- **And much more!**

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each day will have its own folder, named by the day number (e.g., `day-01`, `day-02`). Inside each folder, you'll find:

- A **`README.md`** file explaining the problem and solution for that day.
- The **JavaScript code** implementing the solution.
  
```
├── day-01
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.js
├── day-02
│   ├── README.md
│   └── solution.js
...
└── day-30
    ├── README.md
    └── solution.js
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Zeeshan-web-developer/30-days-of-js.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific day's folder and run the JavaScript file using Node.js or your browser's console.

   Example for Day 1:
   ```bash
   cd day-01
   node solution.js
   ```

## 🌟 Goals

- Sharpen problem-solving skills.
- Improve understanding of core JavaScript concepts.
- Create a personal reference for commonly used JavaScript patterns.
- Share my progress and solutions with the developer community.
